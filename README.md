Ships Clock Sounds

Ships Clock for your Raspberry Pi or Linux distribution
This is a project was inspired by http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Big-Ben-Clock/  but I wanted a ships clock chime.
I was unfamiliar with writing BASH so it was a learning experience for me.
The code works fine but others may find ways to refine it as I started programming in the mid 1960â€™s and like clean compact code.

Crontab entry
